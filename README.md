# astrobio-explorer

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The AstroBio Explorer is a small web-application designed to analyze a curated list of differential gene expression experiments for organisms treated with both spaceflight and simulated microgravity. Using various R packages and the Shiny web development framework, users can both examine results using a variety of interactive plots and download them in a excel spreadsheet format. Using the g:Profiler API, users can also perform automated gene set enrichment analysis to find differentially regulated functional groups from a large subset of the most popular gene annotation databases (Raudvere et al., 2019). The results are displayed in several interactive plots and tables and are available to download.</p>

<p>All data is derived from iGEM Concordia's 2020 project <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Concordia-Montreal">AstroBio.</a></p>
